House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
So to deal with this kind of issues Today we will be preparing a MACHINE LEARNING Based model, trained on the House Price Prediction Dataset. 

#The dataset contains 13 features :

1	Id	To count the records.

2	MSSubClass	 Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.

3	MSZoning	Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.

4	LotArea	 Lot size in square feet.

5	LotConfig	Configuration of the lot

6	BldgType	Type of dwelling

7	OverallCond	Rates the overall condition of the house

8	YearBuilt	Original construction year

9	YearRemodAdd	Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions).

10	Exterior1st	Exterior covering on house

11	BsmtFinSF2	Type 2 finished square feet.

12	TotalBsmtSF	Total square feet of basement area

13	SalePrice	To be predicted
